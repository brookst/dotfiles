dotfiles
========
Repository of my profile settings and scripts. For now, files are stored in
``home/`` and the script ``home/.local/bin/dotfiles`` is used to manage updates.

TODO:
-----
* âœ“ Add git info to the ``dotfiles`` script.
* Determine repository path at runtime throughout.
* Add external repo functionality e.g. for adding vim plugins.
* Per-host configuration (I keep a .bash_local file for extras)
* Fancy colours?
* Key management? (Not sure how to do this securely yet)
